          There's only one corner of the universe you can be sure of improving,
          and that's your own self.
        </p>

          Death comes to all, but great achievements raise a monument which
          shall endure until the sun grows old.

        <p>Life is a horse, and either you ride it or it rides you.</p>
        <p>
          Gravity is not responsible for people to fall in love. It just
          happens. And when it does happen, don't wait for the right time to
          express, because right time is when your heart beats faster. If you
          love someone.. don't wait for tomorrow, or for the other person to
          make the move. Agreed 'Tomorrow never dies', but also remember…
          'Tomorrow never comes, so live in today.'

          Youth is not a time of life; it is a state of mind; it is not a matter
          of rosy cheeks, red lips and supple knees; it is a matter of the will,
          a quality of the imagination, a vigor of the emotions; it is the
          freshness of the deep springs of life.
        </p>
        　　
        <p>
          Youth means a temperamental predominance of courage over timidity, of
          the appetite for adventure over the love of ease. This often exists in
          a man of 60 more than a boy of 20. Nobody grows old merely by a number
          of years. We grow old by deserting our ideals.
        </p>
        　　
        <p>
          Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the
          soul. Worry, fear, self-distrust bows the heart and turns the spirit
          back to dust.
        </p>
        　
        <p>
          　Whether 60 or 16, there is in every human being’s heart the lure of
          wonders, the unfailing appetite for what’s next and the joy of the
          game of living. In the center of your heart and my heart, there is a
          wireless station; so long as it receives messages of beauty, hope,
          courage and power from man and from the infinite, so long as you are
          young.
        </p>
        <p>
          　　When your aerials are down, and your spirit is covered with snows
          of cynicism and the ice of pessimism, then you’ve grown old, even at
          20; but as long as your aerials are up, to catch waves of optimism,
          there’s hope you may die young at 80.
